#Python Functions:
#There are two kinds of functions in Python: 
#   Built-in functions thata are provided as part of Python: print(), input(), type(), float(), int() ...
#   Functions that we define ourselves and then use.
#We treat the built-in function names as "new" reserved words (i.e., we avoid them as variable names)

#Function Defenition:
#In python a function is some reusable code that takes argument(s) as input, does some computation,  and then returns a result or results. 
#We define a function using the def reserved word.
#We call/invoke the function by using the function name, parentheses, and arguments in an expression. 

#Functions of our own 
#Building our own Functions:
#We create a new fuction using the def keyword followed by optional parameters or parentheses.
#We indent the body of the function 
#This defines the function but does not execute the body of the function

#An argument is a value we pass into the function as its input when we call the function

#We put arguments in parenthese after the name of the function

#Reading and Converting

#Raw input munebers must be converted from strings.

#Python dictionaries 
#What is a clllectio?
#A collection is nice because we can put more than one value in it and carry them all around in one convenient package
#We have a bunch of values in a single "variable"
# We do this by having more than one place "in" the variable 
#We have ways of finding the different places in the variable 

#Waht is not a "Collection"?
#Most of our variables have one value in them - when we put a new value in the variable - the old value is overwritten

#A story of two collections...
#List : a linear collection of values that stay in order
#dictionary: a "bag" of values, each with its own label

#Disctionaries are Pythons most powerful data collection
#Dictionaries allow us to do fast database-like operations in Pyhton

#Lists index their entries based on hte position in the list
#Dictionaries are like bags - no order 
#So we index the things we put in the dictionary with a "lookup tag"

#Regular expressions
#In computing, a regular expression, also reffered to as "regex" or "regexp", provides a concise and flexible means for matching strings of text, such as particular characters, words, or patterns of characters. A regular expression is written in a formal language that can be interpreted by a regular expression processor.

#Undesrtanding regular expressions
#Very powerful and quite cryptic
#fun once you understand them
#regular expressions are a language unto themselves
#a language of "marker characters" - programming with characters
#It is kind of an "old school" language - compact
